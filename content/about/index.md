Hello, I'm Naufaldy Pradana, a passionate software developer specializing in mobile app development. My expertise revolves around the following:

## Tech stack

- **Flutter**: I excel in Flutter, where I've mastered deep linking, REST API integration, and proficiently managed state using tools like GetX and Provider. I also have a knack for converting design concepts into code, a skill highly sought after in the industry. Moreover, my commitment to clear and concise documentation ensures smooth collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.
- **Golang**: I'm actively exploring the world of Golang during my spare time, focusing on building simple CRUD applications. My journey in this language is just beginning, and I'm excited to see where it takes me.
- **SQL**: I'm well-versed in SQL, handling tasks such as SELECT, AVG, COUNT, SUM, and conditional logic. While I haven't yet tackled complex cases, my proficiency is evident in my problem-solving approach. You can also check out my SQL skills on my [Hackerrank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/askpradana).

## Leading skill
Leadership is another dimension of my skill set:
- **Leadership**: I've successfully led teams and meetings, streamlining processes and reducing meeting times by up to 50%. In addition, I've overseen frontend mobile development and juggled multiple projects with diverse teams, showcasing my ability to navigate complex project landscapes.
