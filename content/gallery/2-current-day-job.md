In my current role, I bring over **three years of expertise in Flutter**, a versatile and dynamic framework for app development. My proficiency extends to both Flutter 1 and Flutter 2, allowing me to seamlessly adapt to any version. I specialize in creating features from scratch, efficiently maintaining legacy code, and swiftly making necessary modifications. This extensive experience with Flutter has honed my ability to navigate its intricacies, ensuring robust and reliable app development.

My expertise extends beyond Flutter. I possess in-depth knowledge of state management, having effectively utilized technologies like **GetX** and **Provider**. I excel at connecting applications with REST APIs, facilitating seamless data exchange. Hardware integration is second nature to me; I've harnessed **GPS**, **camera** functionalities, **image picking**, and even **screenshot** capabilities in various projects. Moreover, I'm proficient in writing **native** code in **Kotlin** and **Swift**, adding an extra layer of versatility to my skill set.

In addition to technical prowess, I'm a solution-driven engineer who goes beyond mere development. I have a track record of **resolving Play Store and App Store issues**, including compliance with stringent privacy policies. I once helped a client align their privacy policy with Play Store requirements, underscoring my commitment to holistic problem-solving. My role transcends coding; I'm an engineer who thrives on addressing challenges comprehensively and ensuring seamless app experiences for users.
